>"We shall not cease from exploration
>And the end of all our exploring
>will be to arrive where we started
>and know the place for the first time."
>â€” T.S. Eliot, "Little Gidding", *Four Quartets* (1942)


Once I passed a tree where writ<br/>
*April is the cruellest month*<br/>
Disappearing into the bark.<br/>
