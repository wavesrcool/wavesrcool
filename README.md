>"We shall not cease from exploration<br/>
>and the end of all our exploring<br/>
>will be to arrive where we started<br/>
>and know the place for the first time."<br/>
>— T.S. Eliot, "Little Gidding", *Four Quartets* (1942)<br/>

Around the world<br/>
in the rainbow's hue<br/>
roots stir and sleep<br/>
with a mission to do<br/>

A cornucopia here—<br/>
the world, to bestow<br/>
all that we love,<br/>
all that we know<br/>

In many types,<br/>
shape, color, and kind,<br/>
not all are sorted<br/>
or known in rhyme<br/>

The common thread<br/>
woven up and around<br/>
is to give and receieve<br/>
to bind and be bound<br/>
